# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability via Discord.

If you want to contact us via Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/CuWu6kSznf)
and then **confidentially** send a message to the user with the role `@Host` or `@Principal Developer`. Or you can write personally in private messages to `lemird` or `13lackhawk`.

In any case, **do not publicly disclose information about the vulnerability.**
